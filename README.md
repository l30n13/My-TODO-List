# My-TODO-List

This is a very simple TODO application.

### Features:
- Show all the TODO List
- Create new TODO
- Remove TODO from the list

### Future Feature:
- Edit current TODO from the existing list


In this project I tried to implement ``` MVVM``` is used as Structure pattern along with ```clean code```

### In the following here is the folder structure
+ Modules
  + Home
    + Views
    + ViewModels
  + Create TODO
    + Models
    + Views
    + ViewModels
+ CommonModels
+ Helpers
  + Protocols
  + CustomView
  + BaseView
  + Enums
  + Extensions
  + Manager
